# Generating Two PWM Signals in Split Mode

This code example shows how to initialize the Timer/Counter Type A (TCA) in Split mode to generate two single-slope 8-bit Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) signals on two GPIO pins. The signals will be configured with different frequencies and different duty cycles, as follows:
- 1 kHz PWM signal with 50% duty cycle
- 3 kHz PWM signal with 25% duty cycle
